  * standalone version binaray renamed to queso_version
  * removed several redundant files from tarball distribution
  * include install of queso.h versioning header
  * added unifiedReadContents() routine to uqScalarSequenceClass
  * added HDF5 capability to unifiedWriteContents() routine of uqScalarSequenceClass

Version 0.44.0 (22 February 2011)
https://svn.ices.utexas.edu/repos/pecos/uq/queso/releases/0.44.0

  * added uqMpiCommClass
  * added uqMapClass
  * added uqDistArrayClass

    with the change, the minimum dependencies for QUESO are Boost, GSL, and GRVY
  * improved uqScalarSequenceClass and uqSequenceOfVectorsClass

Version 0.43.0 (24 January 2011)
https://svn.ices.utexas.edu/repos/pecos/uq/queso/releases/0.43.0

  * release for Sandia/CSRI

Version 0.42.1 (02 February 2011)
https://svn.ices.utexas.edu/repos/pecos/uq/queso/releases/0.42.1

  * bux fixed for extra MPI_Barrier() calls in uqEnvironmentClass
  * added uqPiecewiseLinear1D1DFunctionClass

Version 0.42.0 (07 December 2010)
https://svn.ices.utexas.edu/repos/pecos/uq/queso/releases/0.42

  * fixed output runtime failure when running multiple chains in parallel
  * fixed race condition in output directory creation
  * inclusion of automatic licensing header support
  * added minimum version requirement for autoconf 
  * added configuration support for the GNU Linear Programming Toolkit (GLPK)
  * added interface to HDF5 for some I/O
  * added quadrature classes
  * added extra cdf computing capabilities on scalar and vector sequences
  * added capability to set QUESO options at run time, without the need of input files
  * added multi-level capability for uniprocessor environments
  * added multi-level capability for multiprocessor environments, including load balancing logic
  * added options on Metropolis Hastings for Brooks-Gelman convergence assessment
  * parameters values in the chain output files are now written with better precision (when written in ASCII format)
  * added extra logical checks throughout the code, for robustness (e.g., check of trilinos map in vector space class)
  * switched to updated API for libGRVY
  * added Wigner pdf
  * added finite distribution capability
  * force LU decomposition on matrix class to run again once a matrix is changed
  * added eigenvalue and eigenvector capabilities to vector class

Version 0.41.0 (30 October 2009)
https://svn.ices.utexas.edu/repos/pecos/uq/queso/releases/0.41

  * user likelihood routines should now return ln(value), instead of -2*ln(value)
  * inclusion of inverse Gamma random variable (in addition to standard uniform and Gaussian options)
  * uniform pdf now returns (1/volume of domain), instead of just 1. If volume is infinite or zero, 
    then the uniform pdf returns 1.
  * random variables can be now be formed by concatenation of existing random variable
    definitions (uniform, Gaussian, inverse Gamma)
  * unified mean and unified sample variance explicitly computed and printed
  * Brooks-Gelman convergence assessment available
  * primary code logic of examples/validationCycle2/src is now in *.C files instead of *.h files
  * update to documentation system, support for "make docs"

https://svn.ices.utexas.edu/repos/pecos/uq/queso/releases/0.40.2

  * bug fix for several header files not included in "make dist" distribution
  * inclusion of additional example files in distribution

Version 0.40.1 (08 September 2009)

  * bug fix for output path containing a filename with no leading ./filename
  * additional examples and comments

Version 0.40.0 (22 July 2009)
https://svn.ices.utexas.edu/repos/pecos/uq/queso/releases/0.4.0

  * option to compute correlation between parameters and QOIs in statistical forward problems
  * dynamic library build for libqueso via libtool
  * configuration support for MPI and HPCT
  * updated examples provided during install (see examples/ directory)
  * introduction of a basic API for statistical inverse problems (includes C/Fortran)

Version 0.30.0 (13 Feb 2009)
https://svn.ices.utexas.edu/repos/pecos/uq/queso/releases/0.3.0

  * autoconf/automake based configuration
  * initial working version with Stochastic Newton
