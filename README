The QUESO Library
=================

QUESO stands for Quantification of Uncertainty for Estimation,
Simulation and Optimization.

QUESO is a collection of algorithms and other functionalities aimed
for the solution of statiscal inverse problems, for the solution of
statistical forward problems, for the validation of a model and for
the prediction of quantities of interest from such model along with
the quantification of their uncertainties.

QUESO is designed for flexibility, portability, easiness of use and
easiness of extension. Its software design follows an object-oriented
approach and its code is written on C++ and over MPI. It can run over
uniprocessor or multiprocessor environments.

Installation
============

If you do not have a `configure' script in the top level directory,
run `bootstrap' to generate a configure script using autotools.

Before compiling, you must run the `configure' script.  To run, type
`./configure'.  Additional options may be provided if desired.  Run
`./configure --help' for details.

After successfully running `configure', type `make' to build the
PECOS Toolkit

Then type `make install' to install it in the directory previously
specified by the '--prefix' option of the `configure' script.
