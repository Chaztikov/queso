The PECOS Toolkit for Predictive Engineering
============================================

This is the PECOS Toolkit for Predictive Engineering,
a collection of algorithms, libraries and executables aimed for
the validation of a model and
the prediction of quantities of interest from such model
along with the quantification of their uncertainties.
It is designed for flexibility, portability, easiness of use and easiness of extension.
Its software design follows an object-oriented approach and
its code is written on C++ and over MPI.
It can run over uniprocessor or multiprocessor environments.
