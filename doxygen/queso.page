<b>Quantification of Uncertainty for Estimation, Simulation and Optimization (QUES0) </b>

The QUESO library is a collection of C++ classes and algorithms aimed
for the validation of a model and the prediction of quantities of
interest from such model along with the quantification of their
uncertainties.  It is designed for flexibility, portability, easiness
of use and easiness of extension.  Its software design follows an
object-oriented approach.  It is written over MPI and it can run over
uniprocessor or multiprocessor environments.

The QUESO library contains two forms of documentation: a User's Manual
available in pdf format and this lower-level code documentation in web
based/html format.
