Steps for 2D line application:

1. Generate the truth data: python gen_truth.py
   - Will creat three text files (obs.txt - observations, sigmas.txt - these are actually variances, xs.txt - corresponding 'x' locations)
   - Also generates the plot showing the original line and corresponding data as obtained by adding a Gaussian noise at the 'x' locations

2. Compile the application: make

3. Run the application: ./line2D_gsl slope_inv_fwd.inp

4. Generate the plots from QUESO output (.txt files): python gen_plots.py
   The plots are contained in the 'Plots' dir.
