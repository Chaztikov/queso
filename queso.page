    The QUESO library is a collection of classes and algorithms aimed for
    the validation of a model and
    the prediction of quantities of interest from such model
    along with the quantification of their uncertainties.
    It is designed for flexibility, portability, easiness of use and easiness of extension.
    Its software design follows an object-oriented approach and
    its code is written on C++ and over MPI.
    It can run over uniprocessor or multiprocessor environments.

    The QUESO library contains two forms of documentation:
    a User's Manual available in pdf format and
    this lower-level code documentation in web based/html format.

    The QUESO library has two main components:
    - <A HREF="../libs/html/index.html">Libraries</A>
    - <A HREF="../examples/html/index.html">Examples (Executables)</A>
