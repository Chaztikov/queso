    The QUESO library is a collection of C++ classes and algorithms aimed for
    the validation of a model and
    the prediction of quantities of interest from such model
    along with the quantification of their uncertainties.
    It is designed for flexibility, portability, easiness of use and easiness of extension.
    Its software design follows an object-oriented approach.
    It is written over MPI and it can run over uniprocessor or multiprocessor environments.

    The QUESO library contains two forms of documentation:
    a User's Manual available in pdf format and
    this lower-level code documentation in web based/html format.

    @section bugs Reporting Bugs

    QUESO is under limited distribution at the moment, meaning that we
    we will work only on bug reports coming from the PECOS team or from research collaborators.

    Bugs in the code and errors or omissions in the documentation can be reported to prudenci@ices.utexas.edu.
    Requests and contributions are welcome at the same e-mail address.

    All bug reports should include:
    <ul>
    <li>the version number of the QUESO library,
    <li>the hardware and operating system,
    <li>the compiler used, including version number and compilation options,
    <li>a description of the bug behaviour, and
    <li>a short program which reproducibly exercises the bug.
    </ul>
