This directory houses simple regression solutions for the baseline
sip+sfp example. A time record of the resulting "screen" output file
is maintained here along with this log which documents changes to the
reference output file

Notes:

-> 12 July 2009: initial reference output file checked in for use with
   automatic regression testing.
