The QUESO-MCMC Tool currently implements the DRAM algorithm \cite{HaLaMiSa06} for the generation of a Markov chain.
Section \ref{sc-gmc-eight-steps} explains how to develop your own application using the DRAM capabilities of the QUESO-MCMC Tool, while
Section \ref{sc-gmc-dram-output} describes the output information generated by the toolkit and
Sections
\ref{sc-gmc-dram-normal-ex},
\ref{sc-gmc-dram-chem-ex} and
\ref{sc-gmc-dram-algae-ex}
describe the three examples available,
all of them also available in \cite{mcmctool}.

The chapter ends at Section \ref{sc-gmc-planned-features} with a brief list of planned features for next toolkit versions w.r.t. Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.
