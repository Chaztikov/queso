The QUESO-MCMC Tool currently runs over uniprocessor Linux environments and requires the following packages to be installed in your computing system:
\begin{itemize}
\item GNU Scientific Library (gsl) \cite{gsl},
\item Boost C++ Libraries \cite{boost} and
%\item MCMC Toolbox for Matlab \cite{mcmctool}.
\end{itemize}
The gsl library is used for many mathematical operations.
The ``Program Options'' library from the Boost C++ Libraries is necessary for the reading of parameters from input files.
%The MCMC Toolbox for Matlab is necessary for the plotting of some of the data generated by the QUESO-MCMC Tool.

\section{Installation Steps}

In order to install the QUESO-MCMC Tool, you have to:
\begin{itemize}
\item {download it:
\begin{itemize}
\item mkdir $<$WORK\_DIR$>$
\item download ``pecos\_toolkit\_v\_0\_1.tar.gz'' from http://www.ices.utexas.edu/centers/pecos to $<$WORK\_DIR$>$
\item cd $<$WORK\_DIR$>$
\item gunzip pecos\_toolkit\_v\_0\_1.tar.gz
\item tar -xvf pecos\_toolkit\_v\_0\_1.tar
\item gzip pecos\_toolkit\_v\_0\_1.tar
\end{itemize}
}
\item {prepare the computational environment:
\begin{itemize}
\item set the variable BOOST\_INCLUDE\_PATH\_FOR\_PECOS\_TOOLKIT
\item set the variable BOOST\_LIB\_PATH\_FOR\_PECOS\_TOOLKIT
\item set the variable COMPILER\_SPEC\_IN\_BOOST\_LIB\_NAME (e.g., to 'gcc41')
\item set the variable GSL\_INCLUDE\_PATH\_FOR\_PECOS\_TOOLKIT
\item set the variable GSL\_LIB\_PATH\_FOR\_PECOS\_TOOLKIT
%\item set the variable MCMC\_TOOLBOX\_PATH\_FOR\_PECOS\_TOOLKIT
\item add ``\$BOOST\_LIB\_PATH\_FOR\_PECOS\_TOOLKIT'' to LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH
\end{itemize}
}
\item {compile the code:
\begin{itemize}
\item cd $<$WORK\_DIR$>$/uq
\item make clean\_all UQBT=gsl
\item make UQBT=gsl
\end{itemize}
}
\end{itemize}
%The QUESO-MCMC Tool assumes that the MCMC Toolbox for Matlab will have:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item its core code located at \$MCMC\_TOOLBOX\_PATH\_FOR\_PECOS\_TOOLKIT/code, and
%\item its examples located at \$MCMC\_TOOLBOX\_PATH\_FOR\_PECOS\_TOOLKIT/examples.
%\end{itemize}

Also, if you wish to run the Sandia's DAKOTA Toolkit \cite{dakota} with the applications provided by the QUESO-MCMC Tool, then you will need to:
\begin{itemize}
\item add ``$<$WORK\_DIR$>$/uq/examples/fp/heatex'' to your PATH.
\end{itemize}

If you want to generate documentation, just run
\begin{itemize}
\item cd $<$WORK\_DIR$>$/uq
\item make all\_docs
\end{itemize}
These commands will generate ``./html/'' subdirectories containing lower-level code documentation throughout the PECOS toolkit directory.
The user is able to navigate through this documentation by pointing a web browser to $<$WORK\_DIR$>$/uq/html/index.html.

\section{Directory Tree Overview}

Under the directory ``$<$WORK\_DIR$>$/uq/'' there are three subdirectories:
\begin{itemize}
\item uq/docs/, which contains the User's Manual,%and the Developer's Manual,
\item {uq/examples/, which contains examples of applications for
\begin{itemize}
\item MCMC methods (uq/examples/mcmc/) and
\item forward propagation computations using DAKOTA (uq/examples/fp/), and
\end{itemize}
}
\item uq/libs/, which contains the libraries used by the applications under uq/examples/.
\end{itemize}

The examples for MCMC methods are explained in Chapter \ref{ch-gmc}.
The examples for forward propagation are explained in Chapter \ref{ch-fp}.
%The libraries under uq/libs are explained in the Developer's Manual.
