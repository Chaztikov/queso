%The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the main concepts and results necessary for
%a more formal treatment of the prediction problem.
%Section \ref{sc-intro-qoi} presents a first mathematical model of a system, as well as the applicability of Bayes' theorem to our prediction problem.
%The chapter finishes with the presentation of a more detailed model of a system in Section \ref{sc-intro-detail}.
